Spark a Brighter Queer Future: Help Us Build a Safe, Creative Community Space!
1. Tell Your Authentic Story
I never planned on being a dad so soon, but when my nephew needed someone to step in as a father figure, I did what felt right. Overnight, I found myself balancing parenthood with my passion for engineering, while fighting to keep my head above water. Throughout these challenges, one thing remained clear: our LGBTQ+ community needs—and deserves—spaces where we can fully be ourselves.

I’ve felt firsthand how stifling it is to hide your sparkle, to play it small when you’re bursting with brilliance. Why shouldn’t we wear a cape to the bar if it makes us feel powerful, or shout our truths from the rooftops? We should never have to shrink or be shoved back in a closet. Our identities are worth celebrating every single day.

For me, building a community space is the ultimate act of love—for my nephew, for every queer kid out there, and for those of us who just need a place to unapologetically shine.

2. Define Your Cosmic Impact
Our mission is to create a safe, inclusive haven where queer youth and adults alike can explore art, music, and creativity without fear or shame. Picture:

Open-mic nights showcasing queer voices in poetry, drag, comedy, and beyond.

Workshops and mentorship programs for LGBTQ+ youth to discover their talents, passions, and confidence.

All-ages events so our younger generation can see there’s a community that loves and supports them just as they are.

This space will empower us to live proudly, protect those who might feel alone, and celebrate the beautiful spectrum of queer existence.

3. Set a Clear, Attainable Goal
We’re aiming to raise $X,XXX to cover:

First and Last Month’s Rent: Ensuring we can secure a safe, accessible location.

Renovations & Equipment: From sound systems for performances to comfortable seating for all-day creativity jams.

Programming & Outreach: Fund free or low-cost events and workshops for LGBTQ+ youth, plus essential marketing to reach those who need us most.

Every dollar directly fuels a thriving queer community—one that stands tall, proud, and limitless.

4. Create Stellar Visuals
When you visit our campaign page, you’ll see:
